How I Prepared for My SANS Courses: My Indexing System for GFACT, GSEC, and GCIH.

When I began preparing for my SANS exams (GFACT, GSEC, and GCIH), I knew that efficient information retrieval would be critical. The open-book format may sound forgiving, but under time pressure, flipping endlessly through materials can quickly lead to frustration and anxiety. I needed a strategy that would allow me to locate answers fast and stay focused throughout the exam. Here’s the method I used.

Step 1: Color-Coding for Instant Book Recognition<br/>
Each SANS book was assigned a specific color. I used this color consistently: tabs, highlighters, sticky notes — everything. This helped my brain form a visual memory of where content lived. If I saw something highlighted in orange, I instantly knew it came from Book 2, for example. Color became a shortcut for context.

Step 2: Tabbing by Page Intervals, Not Concepts<br/>
Instead of using traditional concept-based sticky tabs (which would have cluttered the books and driven me insane), I tabbed every book in 20-page increments. This created a quick navigation structure without overwhelming the page edges. During the exam, I could jump to any section with minimal effort.

Step 3: Structured Indexing in Excel<br/>
To build the index, I created a simple table in Excel with three columns:

- Name: The term or concept
- Page: The exact page number
- Notes: Quick references, acronyms, or definitions

I went through each book page by page, recording entries and assigning row colors to match the book they came from. Once the raw data was complete, I sorted everything alphabetically. This grouped related topics together — for example, “Assembly Basics,” “Assembly Instructions,” “Assembly Registers” — making them easier to locate under pressure.

Step 4: Refining the Index After Deep Reading<br/>
After indexing, I read through all the books again. As I reviewed the material, I added practical notes to the printed version of the index — including commands, definitions, and shortcut examples. Once the reading phase was done, I returned to Excel and updated everything digitally, including formatting the fonts and spacing to make it easier to scan during the exam.

Step 5: Adding Alphabet Tabs to the Index<br/>
To speed up lookup time even more, I added the first letter and organize in alphabetical order. This allowed me to create alphabet tabs on the edge of my printed index. Now, if I needed to look up “Kerberos,” my eyes jumped straight to the “K” tab — no scanning, no delay.

Step 6: Allocating Space for Practice Exam Notes<br/>
At the back of the index, I left several blank pages to collect notes from my practice exams. Each time I took a practice test, I documented missed questions and added missing info to the index. This iterative process helped me patch knowledge gaps and make sure my index was aligned with the kind of questions I’d encounter.

Lab Book Strategy: Tailored Tabs and a Separate Command Indexs<br/>
For the GSEC and GCIH courses, I followed the same indexing and tabbing strategy as with the other books. However, when it came to the lab books, I made a few adjustments to better support hands-on material during the exam. Instead of tabbing the labs by page intervals, I wrote the name of each lab directly on the tabs. This made it much easier to identify and jump straight to a specific lab without scanning multiple sections. In addition to that, I created a separate index exclusively for the labs, where each lab had its own section listing all the commands used, in the exact order they appeared. This helped me quickly reference syntax, tools, and commands without flipping through the entire lab book — a huge time-saver during exam scenarios that required technical recall.

After refining my index and reviewing the material multiple times, I found myself making several adjustments to make it truly work for me. Through repetition and practice, I started to naturally memorize patterns — even recalling where certain content lived on the page or which book it belonged to, sometimes without even needing to use the index. I also noticed that certain topics and pages kept popping up during the practice exams, and some concepts were always tested in one form or another. That’s when I decided to add extra tabs for high-frequency topics, giving me quick access to critical concepts I knew would come up. This small tweak made a big impact during the real exam — it shaved off precious seconds and gave me more time to focus on questions instead of searching through pages.

GCIH Exam Strategy<br/>
By the time I started preparing for the GCIH exam, this was already my third SANS training, and I knew exactly what worked for me. I applied the same indexing, color-coding, tabbing, and lab organization strategies. The only major change I made was how I physically organized the materials. Instead of keeping the books separate, I consolidated everything into two large binders, one for all the course books and another for all the lab materials. Since GCIH has a lot of content, this method helped me keep everything structured and easy to flip through. Having the material grouped together in binders also made transportation and setup during the exam much easier. It was the final piece that tied my system together.
